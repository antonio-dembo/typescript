Type script compiler

After that we should compile the TypeScript code into plain JavaScript. 
Create a “tsconfig.json” file in the project folder and add the following content:

{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "outDir": "./out",
        "rootDir": "./src",
        "sourceMap": true,
        "moduleResolution": "node",
        "target": "es5"
    }
}

NPM-Scripts
What we also need is the well-known “package.json” file. Simply run the following commands in your terminal to create it and to add the required dependencies:

npm init --yes
npm install typescript --save-dev

Next we add the required scripts to the “package.json” file, which finally looks similar to this:

{
  "name": "vscode-typescript-debugging",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "devDependencies": {
    "typescript": "^2.7.2"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node out/app.js",
    "prestart": "npm run build",
    "build": "tsc"
  }
}

Short explanation of the scripts:

start — run the compiled app with node
prestart — is called automatically before the start script
build — runs the TypeScript compiler

Run the app
Open your terminal and run the following command:

npm start

Eventually you should see the “Hello world!” in your terminal and the 
compiled JavaScript-files in the “out” folder. 

# Git commands

Use the universal one-liner in terminal in the project directory:

- On linux env
touch .gitignore && echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore && git rm -r --cached node_modules ; git status
